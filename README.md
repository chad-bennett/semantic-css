# semantic-css

a simple classless css stylesheet to dress up default html. 

the demo page is at [https://chad-bennett.github.io/semantic-css/](https://chad-bennett.github.io/semantic-css/)

## to use

download **main.css** to the same folder as your html files and include `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css">` in the head of your html file. 

_or_ 

simply put `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://chad-bennett.github.io/semantic-css/main.css">`in the head of your html file. this option might be slower, but you can be guaranteed to have the most current version.

still most definitely a work in progress. please let me know if you have any corrections or improvements or share what you make with it.
