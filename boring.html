            <h3>what is this?</h3>
            <p><strong>this is what it looks like without the stylesheet.</strong></p>
            <p>A simple opinionated <em>classless</em> stylesheet to make
                default html look better. There aren't any special classes or
                ids, just straight semantic html. Load the stylesheet and add
                your content.</p>
            <p>This is a good, quick stylesheet to throw on top of simple html
                to get a decent looking presentation. You aren't going to make
                overly complex websites with this, but still better than what
                the browser gives you.</p>
            <p>This content is in a <strong>section</strong> so it works for
                making different styled cards.</p>

            This is <mark>mark text</mark> and this is <strong>strong
                text</strong> and this is <em>emphasized text</em>. Of course it
            works for <b>bold
                text</b> and <i>italic text</i>. Here's <a href="#">a link
                here</a> because those are important to have. You can also have
            <sub>sub</sub> or <sup>sup</sup> and <del>deleted
                strikethrough</del> text.
        </p>

        <p>
            More stuff here. This is
            <code>inline code text</code> for when you want something inline.
            Looks good for code, huh?
        </p>

        <pre>this is full on code text that displays in its own box.</pre>
